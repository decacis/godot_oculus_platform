# Godot Oculus Platform Documentation

## Introduction

This is the documentation site for the Godot Oculus Platform, an implementation of the [Oculus Platform SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/ps-platform-intro/) for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

While you can use this plugin in the editor to get code suggestions, it **only works with the Meta Quest (Android), not PCVR (Rift) at the moment**. If you plan to develop for both the Quest and Rift, you should add a platform check and only use this plugin when the platform is Android.

Please note that both the documentation and the plugin itself are in development and may be incomplete.
